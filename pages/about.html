<body>
    <p>My vision is to see a world where everyone is capable of living a sustainable life, have more employment opportunities out there, opportunities for the specially abled, and much more... which is why I have chosen to learn full stack web development as I view it as a possible way to achieve all these goals. I thank angela for the amazing workshop which really helped me kickstart this journey of mine</p>
